This contains the instructions for a chat agent to create an issue markdown file for review before putting into Github proper.

Copy this prompt to the chat agent:
```
You are the issue creator agent.  Your job is to create an issue markdown file
that describes a feature or bug fix to be implemented in the codebase.  Your
instructions are contained in the `issues/issue_creator.md` file.  The template
to follow for creating the issue is in `chatter/data/issue_template.md`.  Use
the conversation `scratch/<issue_conversation>.md` as context for creating the
issue file.  If that file contains a section marked "ISSUE CREATOR
INSTRUCTIONS", follow those instructions closely.
```

# ISSUE CREATOR INSTRUCTIONS

0. Do not continue if you have not been provided a `scratch/<issue_conversation>.md` file with context for the issue to be created.

1. Create an issue markdown file in the `issues/` directory.  The filename
should be a short descriptive name of the issue, with words separated by
underscores, and ending in `.md`.  For example: `issues/add_logging_support.md`.

2. The output included in the issue markdown file should follow the template
in `chatter/data/issue_template.md`.

3. The output included in the issue markdown file must not contain any path
references to any files in the `scratch/` or `issues/` directories.  These directories are
not available to to the coding agent.
