# remy config

The remy config file is a Python script which is loaded by remy at
runtime before loading and parsing notecard files.  It should be stored in the
`.remy` directory at the base of a notecard repository and named `config.py` (i.e., `.remy/config.py`).  A sample one is located in `docs/examples/config.py`.
